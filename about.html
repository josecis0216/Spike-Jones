                        <h3>Statement of Need</h3>
                        <p>When the instigators of the Spike Jones
                          Project got started there was no complete repository of
                          Spike Jones' material. There was no place for fans, researchers,
                          students, educators, and music lovers to access the vast works of
                          one
                          of the last century's most incredible and creative bandleaders.
                          There was also
                          a massive collection of material which was still in
                          analog form and would continue to decay and degrade over time. That
                          collection
                          needed to be digitized in high resolution form as soon as possible,
                          and there needed
                          to be a place where these works could be accessed and researched.

                        <h3>About the Website</h3>
                        <p>The Spike Jones Project is a collaborative undertaking to restore, archive and share the
                          massive media collection produced by the one and only Spike Jones. It all started with
                          Utah Valley University professor Mike Wisland’s passion for preserving music history.
                          To Wisland, preserving music history does not mean to keep records in a vault, or hoard
                          them away in some personal collection, but instead to bring music and film from an
                          earlier era to life in the hearts and minds of younger generations. Over the past
                          decade, Wisland and Students have carefully restored 100’s of vinyl records, photos,
                          and conducted interviews with the Spike Jones Family, Joe Siracusa (Spike’s
                          drummer), Skip Craig (band boy), Jordan R. Young (biographer), Barret Hansen (Dr.
                          Demento), Ted Hering and Randy Morris. Those will be posted over time. We also
                          hope to implement the ability of fans to upload files to the site as well.
                          Thanks goes out to all the previous members of the Spike Project past and present!
                          Current Project members are Brooklyne Cheney and Jose Cisneros on website design,
                          and Cody Kopaska and Emily Taggart on Video Editing and 78 Transcriptions.</p>

                          <h3>Mike Wisland</h3>
                          <p> Professor Mike Wisland has been a Spike Jones fan since they age of 15 when 
                            unknowingly listening to the Dr. Demento show on his rock radio station.  
                            Being a (bored) professional clarinet player, it instantly appealed to him. 
                             About 20 years ago, Bob Whitby donated his extensive collection of Spike 
                             objects to Mr. Wisland because he was busily transcribing his own collection
                              to one of the first 192 KHz, 24 bit recorders, which appealed to Bob.  
                              So at that point, since the record labels were only releasing the hits, 
                              that he might someday somehow share the collection to a broader audience. 
                               Then Mr. Wisland became an Audio Professor Wisland in 2003, in the Digital
                                Media Department at Utah Valley University. An odd coincidence of my students
                              
                                 competing at the Audio Engineering Society's Student Competition, we met 
                                 a Judge from Skywalker Sound named Leslie Ann Jones (VP of Music and Scoring). 
                                 A former student whispered into his ear "she's also Spike Jones daughter". 
                                 So Mike introduced himself to her and that started a relationship with her. 
                                  We pursued for a while how he might share his collection with the world. 
                                  Students needed Senior Projects to work on, so Audio Restoration and Web-dev 
                                  students seemed like a logical pitch for what we've been calling The Spike 
                                  Jones Project.  And you are looking at it now. Jason Knoell, the first student 
                                  to take this on and furthermore take 5 students to AES LA, and meet with the 
                                  Jones Family which later led to interviews which we will soon be placing on
                                   this website amounts others for the public to view.
